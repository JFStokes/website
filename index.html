        <p style="color: greenyellow; font-family: monospace;">I created this website as a practical project to deepen my understanding of web development and security. This platform serves as both a learning tool and a personal documentation space, where I can consolidate and share the knowledge I've acquired. Through building and maintaining this website, I aim to explore the intricacies of web technologies, enhance my skills in safeguarding online information, and provide a centralized resource for anyone interested in the same journey of learning and growth.</p>
