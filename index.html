        <h3>Hello, my name is Josh and I am a cybersecurity student.</h3>
        <p class="intro">I created this website as a practical project to deepen my understanding of web development and security. This platform serves as both a learning tool and a personal documentation space, where I can consolidate and share the knowledge I've acquired. Through building and maintaining this website, I aim to explore the intricacies of web technologies, enhance my skills in safeguarding online information, and provide a centralized resource for anyone interested in the same journey of learning and growth.</p>
